# Applied-Social-Network-Analysis-In-Python

This project includes weekly demos and assignments from the final course of https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python

Description:

This course will introduce the learner to network analysis through tutorials using the NetworkX library. The course begins with an understanding of what network analysis is and motivations for why we might model phenomena as networks. The second week introduces the concept of connectivity and network robustness. The third week will explore ways of measuring the importance or centrality of a node in a network. The final week will explore the evolution of networks over time and cover models of network generation and the link prediction problem.
